## Roblox-Extension-Logger

"fake" based extension logger to lure in stupid beamers using JS. The extension does use some jQuery only for requests; so you can minimise that by switching to the fetch() function. 

## Publishing the extension
there's an article on how to upload an extension, read that: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish/. there's the .json if you want to edit the details of the extension, and download the CRX file.

## How to get hits..???
